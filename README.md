# Feed Reader Testing
Its a testing code for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
# Test Logic
- First the test is implemented using jasmine [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
- There is 4 test suits. 
- First one expects the loadFeeds array that has all feeds URL and names to be defined and not empty.
- and loops through each feed and ensure that name and URL are defined and not empty.
- Second test suit is about the menu,it ensure that the menu is hidden by default and it will change its visiblity by click. 
- and it will be hidden again by another click.
- Third test suit ensure that one the page loaded there is an intial content on it. 
- Third test suit ensure that content is changes by comparing the first and second content.
